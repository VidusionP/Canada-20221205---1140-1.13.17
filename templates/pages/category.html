                        Overall it'll take anywhere from 2-3 months to receive your customized stock hairpiece. The wait time depends on the base of the stock hair system that you are customizing. Receiving a customized stock basic model can take up to two months; a stock lace system can take up to three months, and finally, a stock skin-based hairpiece can take between two to three months.

                            Each installation lasts 6-8 weeks depending on the speed of the client's hair growth. You need to book your clients to do a re-taping and reinstallation service to move the tape in extension up to the root for the hair again. Depending on the quality of the hair, and the clients wearing and maintenance habits, the tape in extension can be reinstalled 3-6 times. We recommend 3 reinstallations for our 3A/4A hair extensions and 6 reinstallations for our 5A/6A hair extensions. Overall, 3A/4A tape in extensions will last 3-5 months and 5A/6A tape in extensions will last 6-10 months.

                            First, wash and dry your hair so your extensions last longer. Then part your hair at the back and apply the extension right near the scalp where your hair is parted. Take a thin portion of your hair and place it below the extension before applying another extension to sandwich it. Make sure to press the tape in extensions firmly for 10-20 seconds and then you're all set. Repeat the process for others.

                            Hair extensions tend to tangle so it's important to brush your hair regularly. When you take a shower, apply shampoo right at the roots of your hair extensions and work your way down. Apply conditioner, wash, and dry your hair with a towel carefully. Use a hair dryer to ensure none of your hair extensions are wet.

                            Tie your hair up so your extensions are in full view. Apply a non-chemical tape glue remover to the extension tape and let it seep for a bit before removing the extension. You can also apply the remover for any leftover residue on your hair. <a href="https://www.superhairpieces.com/toupee-wig-hair-system-blog/how-to-remove-clean-prep-tape-extensions/">Read More</a>

                            We recommend going for hair extensions that are 3'' to 4'' inches longer than your natural hair length. It is also best if your natural hair length is at least 4'' to 5'' inches long to help you conceal and blend the extensions into your hair.

                            All our hair extensions are made with real human hair. As for which hair extension you should go for, it ultimately depends on your hair and needs. If you have thin hair, you may require a different hair extension than someone who might have more thick hair. Or if you're looking for hair extensions for special occasions, a particular hair extension may suit you more than one which is for a more permanent basis.

                            We recommend going for hair extensions that are 3" to 4" inches longer than your natural hair length. It is also best if your natural hair length is at least 4'' to 5'' inches long to help you conceal and blend the extensions into your hair.

                            Both extensions have their pros and cons. Individual lashes are safe and easy to wear as they are not heavy and can last a couple of weeks. <a href="https://superhairpieces.ca/eyelash-cluster-extension-d-curl-11-mm/" target="_blank">Cluster lashes</a>, on the other hand, are heavy which can cause damage to your lashes and skin, and typically lasts a week at most. However, they are cheap compared to individual lashes and can also be applied on the eyelid skin to reduce shedding. They produce a more dramatic look for your lashes.

                            Both D and DD curls are types of lash extensions that are designed to produce a more curled look when applied on your natural lashes. The difference between them is simply that the DD has a tighter and more dramatic curl compared to the D curl.

                            <strong>Note: </strong>It is best to have a professional remove them for your safety. Make sure to use an oil-free remover. There are two types of remover you can use -- the cream remover or the <a href="https://superhairpieces.ca/eyelash-gel-remover/" target="_blank">gel remover</a>. The cream remover is more ideal for those with sensitive skin as it causes less irritation. Apply an eye patch to the lashes you aren't removing yet (lower or upper). Using a cotton swab, apply the remover from the base of your natural lashes up to the extensions. Make sure the eyes are closed during this process. Try not to make contact with the skin or lash line. Let it sit for a few minutes to allow the bonds to weaken. Gently slide them off with a cotton swab and they should come off easily. You can also use <a href="https://superhairpieces.ca/eyelash-pick-up-tweezer/" target="_blank">a tweezer</a> but be careful as it can damage your natural lashes. Using fresh cotton swabs, remove any leftover remover on the natural lashes. Gently remove the eye patch and apply foam cleanser thoroughly to your lashes before rinsing. Repeat the process for the other set of lashes.

                            There are different types of human hair wigs with the major differences being the type of bases and the type of hair that is being used. From mono wigs, lace front wigs, <a href="/women/in-stock/search-by-base/full-cap-wigs/full-lace-wig/">full lace wigs</a> to even poly skin wigs, these are wig bases that provide specific features and qualities that can suit a particular person's lifestyle and needs. There are also different types of human hair used in women's wigs such as Chinese, Indian, European and more.

                            Lace material is known for being extremely natural-looking and providing a seamless appearance. But which one is better — a full lace wig or a lace front wig? A full lace wig uses lace material throughout the hairpiece which means it will be natural-looking throughout. They are also breathable, light and come with many styling options. However, they can be messy to attach and remove in the maintenance process.
                        </p>
                        <p>A lace front wig only utilizes lace material in the front, but this helps in achieving a natural-looking front hairline. The rest of the unit will feature poly skin or monofilament material or a combination of both which provides additional durability and easy attachment options. Additionally, they are slightly more affordable than full lace wigs.</p>
                        <p>So in the end, it's all down to your preference and what you're looking for with your wigs for women.</p>

                            It's important to measure your head size so you get a wig that fits you correctly and comfortably. This helps prevent potential irritation and ensure a more natural-looking appearance. For example, a wig that is much bigger than your actual head size will not look natural and can be a dead giveaway that you're wearing a hairpiece.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To get the appropriate measurements for a women's wig, you will need a measuring tape and a marker so that you can measure the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The circumference of your head</li>
                                <li>The front to nape</li>
                                <li>Ear to ear</li>
                                <li>Ear to ear across the top</li>
                                <li>Temple to temple around the back</li>
                                <li>The nape of the neck</li>
                            </ul>

                            If you are wearing a wig for medical purposes due to alopecia or if you're undergoing chemotherapy, you may be eligible to have your purchase covered by insurance. It would usually be classified as a cranial prosthetic. With that said, it all comes down to your specific insurance provider and whether they cover it. It is best to speak with your insurance provider and inquire whether that is the case and if so, how much they will cover.
