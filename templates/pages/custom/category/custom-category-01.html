                    <h2>Online Service</h2>
                    <p>We have many male clients struggling to find the right hair stylist to style their brand new hairpiece, or local hair replacement centers are not willing to style a hairpiece for them. Now, you can purchase the online styling while you buy the hairpiece from us. You can select the hair style # as well as the hair length on the side and back. This hairpiece ready to wear service can also be used with your used toupee, hairpiece for repair or even simply a photo you pick up from your old album. Our on site hair stylists have been working with hairpieces everyday and they are all hairpiece professionals. Your hairpiece can be styled with layers, and we can thin down the density as needed. If you like the hair to be more curly / wavy, you can also select the online perm service. </p>
